## SDG 2 – Zero Hunger Insights Dashboard

---

##  Project Overview

This project presents an advanced data analytics solution focused on **Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – Zero Hunger**, using official indicator data from the **United Nations SDG Data Portal (2015–2025)**.

The solution integrates **SQL Server** for data engineering and **Microsoft Power BI** for advanced analytics and visualization. Interactive dashboards help stakeholders explore food security, nutrition outcomes, agricultural productivity, and government policy alignment to support **evidence-based decision-making**.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze global progress toward **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**
- Identify trends in food insecurity, malnutrition, and anaemia
- Compare agricultural contribution to GDP vs government expenditure
- Highlight disparities between large-scale and small-scale producers
- Support policy formulation using interactive BI dashboards

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Query Language:** T-SQL  
- **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI  
- **Analytics:** Advanced DAX  
- **Data Source:** United Nations SDG Data Portal  

---

##  Dataset

**Source:** United Nations SDG Global Database  
<https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database>

Key indicator categories include:
- Food insecurity (moderate & severe)
- Undernourishment
- Child stunting and anaemia (women & children)
- Agricultural GDP share
- Government expenditure on agriculture
- Agriculture Orientation Index
- Productivity and income of food producers

---


### 6. Visualization
- Built interactive dashboards with slicers and bookmarks
- Enabled analysis by year, country, region, and indicator
- Delivered policy-focused KPIs and trend insights

---

##  Key Insights

- Significant disparities exist in progress toward **Zero Hunger**
- Child stunting and anaemia remain persistent global challenges
- Government spending on agriculture is often misaligned with its GDP contribution
- Small-scale producers face productivity and income disadvantages
- Current trends indicate SDG 2 targets are **unlikely to be met by 2030** without stronger policy alignment and investment

---

##  Real-World Impact

- Supports global and national **food security policy decisions**
- Enables monitoring of SDG 2 progress across countries and regions
- Assists development agencies with evidence-based interventions
- Demonstrates the power of BI tools in sustainable development analytics
